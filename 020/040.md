# Attacker can sandwich call to `unpause` and steal most funds from the strategy

## Summary
Attacker can sandwich call to `unpause` and steal most funds from the strategy

## Vulnerability Detail
If we look at `unpause`, we'll see that it does not have a `onlyCalmPeriods` modifier.

```solidity
    function unpause() external onlyManager {
        if (owner() == address(0)) revert NotAuthorized();
        _giveAllowances();
        _unpause();
        _setTicks();
        _addLiquidity();
    }
```

While it can be expected that owner will properly use that function, an attacker might utilize this issue and steal most vault funds.

Consider the following scenario: 
1. WETH/DAI strategy is currently paused with $100,000 in each token
2. Contract owner calls `unpause`
3. Attacker front-runs that transaction and sells a large amount of WETH in the pool, dropping the price to $1.
4. `unpause` tx now executes. `_setTicks` centers the position, setting the ticks close to the $1 price. WETH liquidity is now added around the $1 range.
5. Attacker back-runs the `unpause` transaction and manages to buy back the strategy's WETH at $1 price.

## Impact
Upon every `unpause` call, attacker can steal one of the vault's token supply.
