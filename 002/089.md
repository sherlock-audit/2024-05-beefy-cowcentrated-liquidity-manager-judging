# No slippage check on position minting

## Summary
`amount0Min` & `amount1Min` are hardcoded to 0, when a position is minted, which may result in unfavourable position being minted and loss of funds. 
```solidity
    function _mintPosition(int24 _tickLower, int24 _tickUpper, uint256 _amount0, uint256 _amount1, bool _mainPosition) private {
        INftPositionManager.MintParams memory mintParams = INftPositionManager.MintParams({
            token0: lpToken0,
            token1: lpToken1,
            tickSpacing: _tickDistance(),
            tickLower: _tickLower,
            tickUpper: _tickUpper,
            amount0Desired: _amount0,
            amount1Desired: _amount1,
            amount0Min: 0,
            amount1Min: 0,
            recipient: address(this),
            deadline: block.timestamp,
            sqrtPriceX96: 0
        });
```
## Vulnerability Detail
This is a serious issue, because `onlyCalmPeriod` may not be enough under certain circumstances. For example, if `twapPeriod` is low and it is profitable for the attacker to manipulate the pool for that amount of time, he would be able to lose stakers funds by opening a new position, which liquidity for `token0` and `token1` = 0.
Combined with the fact that there is no effective deadline set, validators could delay the mint transaction and execute it later with less favorable terms. 
## Impact

## Recommendation
Implement an oracle, and an amount deviation check when you try to mint the position
