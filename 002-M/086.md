# StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol#setRewardPool() - When changing `rewardPool` allowances are kept and aren't give to the new `rewardPool`

## Summary
StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol#setRewardPool() - When changing `rewardPool` allowances are kept and aren't give to the new `rewardPool`

## Vulnerability Detail
This issue is almost the same as [7.3.3 from this previous audit](https://github.com/beefyfinance/beefy-audits/blob/master/2024-04-06-Beefy-Cyfrin-CLM-Audit.pdf)

When changing the `rewardPool`, we don't give allowances to the new `rewardPool`, this will be an issue when calling `rewardPool.notifyRewardAmount` as the function will use `safeTransferFrom` to attempt to pull the reward tokens out of `StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome`, which will revert, since it doesn't have an allowance.

Also the old allowance isn't removed, which shouldn't be the case.

## Impact
DoS of `harvest` and leftover allowance to old `rewardPool`

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Mirror the logic inside `setUnirouter`

```jsx
function setRewardPool(address _rewardPool) external onlyOwner {
        _removeAllowances();
        rewardPool = _rewardPool;
        _giveAllowances();
        emit SetRewardPool(_rewardPool);
    }
```
