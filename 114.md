# The `unpause` function is not logically correct

## Summary
The Contest ReadMe state that
> Should potential issues, like broken assumptions about function behavior, be reported if they could pose risks in future integrations, even if they might not be an issue in the context of the scope? If yes, can you elaborate on properties/invariants that should hold?
>Yes

The `unpause` function will always revert due to this check `if (owner() == address(0)) revert NotAuthorized();` because the `pause` function can only be called when the strategy owner calls `retireVault`. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The strategy support the `pausable` feature , which allows the owner of strategy to `pause` and `unpause` the strategy. However in the `StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome` the only instance where the strategy can be `paused` is inside the `retireVault`. lets have a look at `retireVault` code :
```solidity
794:     function retireVault() external onlyOwner {
795:         if (IBeefyVaultConcLiq(vault).totalSupply() != 10**3) revert NotAuthorized(); // supply == 10**3 => 1000 , 99 , 999 , <-
796:         panic(0,0);
797:         address feeRecipient = beefyFeeRecipient();
798:         // @audit : the pool will ot expire if tokenon zero transfer fail
799:         IERC20Metadata(lpToken0).safeTransfer(feeRecipient, IERC20Metadata(lpToken0).balanceOf(address(this)));
800:         IERC20Metadata(lpToken1).safeTransfer(feeRecipient, IERC20Metadata(lpToken1).balanceOf(address(this)));
801:         _transferOwnership(address(0));
802:     }
```
As it can be observed that at line `801` the ownership of strategy has transferred to `address(0)`.  now lets have a look at `unpause` function :
```solidity
820:     function unpause() external onlyManager {
821:         if (owner() == address(0)) revert NotAuthorized();
822:         _giveAllowances();
823:         _unpause();
824:         _setTicks();
825:         _addLiquidity();
826:     }
```
At line `821` we check that if the `owner==address(0)` then revert.  So the use case where this function could be used is not possible in current implementation.

## Impact
The `unpause` function will never be executed successfully.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an other function which will allows the owner to `pause` the strategy. perform all the things which are done in `retireVault` but don't transfer the ownership to `address(0).`
