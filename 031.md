# [M-1] Unsafe casting of user amount from uint256 to uint128

## Summary
The unsafe casting from uint256 to uint128 may cause lose of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
- Downcasting int/uints in Solidity can be unsafe due to the potential for data loss and unintended behavior.When downcasting a larger integer type to a smaller one (e.g., uint256 to uint128), the value may exceed the range of the target type,leading to truncation and loss of significant digits.

## Impact
can leading to truncation and loss of significant digits.

## Recommendation
use OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeCast library when casting from uint256 to uint128.
