# positionAlt tick is stale for amount0 == bal1

## Summary

In the function `_setAltTick`, the tick range for the alternative position `altPosition` is set. However, there is a specific scenario identified where the tick positions might not be updated when amount0 == bal1. This could potentially lead to suboptimal liquidity placement and reduced rewards for the strategy.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the code below, we see amount0 > 0 as it is a function of `bal0 and price()`, there is a possibility the value of amount0 is equal to bal1, and for this scenario, the `positionAlt` is not updated and becomes stale until the condition changes during rebalancing.

```solidity
function _setAltTick(int24 tick, int24 distance, int24 width) private {
        (uint256 bal0, uint256 bal1) = balancesOfThis();

        // We calculate how much token0 we have in the price of token1. 
        uint256 amount0;

        if (bal0 > 0) {
            amount0 = bal0 * price() / PRECISION;
        }

        // We set the alternative position based on the token that has the most value available. 
        if (amount0 < bal1) {
            (positionAlt.tickLower, ) = TickUtils.baseTicks(
                tick,
                width,
                distance
            );

            (positionAlt.tickUpper, ) = TickUtils.baseTicks(
                tick,
                distance,
                distance
            ); 
        } else if (bal1 < amount0) {
            (, positionAlt.tickLower) = TickUtils.baseTicks(
                tick,
                distance,
                distance
            );

            (, positionAlt.tickUpper) = TickUtils.baseTicks(
                tick,
                width,
                distance
            ); 
        }
    }
```

## Impact

Medium impact as this could potentially lead to suboptimal liquidity placement and reduced rewards for the strategy.
