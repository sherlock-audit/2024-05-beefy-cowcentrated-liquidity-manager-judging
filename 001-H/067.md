# No slippage protection in the `_mintPosition`

## Summary
The [StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome::_mintPosition](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-beefy-cowcentrated-liquidity-manager/blob/main/cowcentrated-contracts/contracts/strategies/velodrome/StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol#L305-L327) function mints a new liquidity position using Uniswap V3. However, this function lacks slippage protection. According to the [Uniswap V3 Development Book](https://uniswapv3book.com/milestone_3/slippage-protection.html#:~:text=Slippage%20Protection%20in%20Minting), slippage protection should be implemented in the mint function to ensure that the liquidity provided is proportional to the current price and that the user is not exposed to unexpected token amounts due to price fluctuations.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome::_mintPosition` does not include slippage protection. Specifically, it sets `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` to `0`, meaning there are no checks to ensure the amounts of tokens provided are within an acceptable range considering slippage. This can result in liquidity providers receiving fewer tokens than expected, causing potential losses.

## Impact
Medium. With no protection, liquidity providers may experience significant slippage during the minting process. This will create scenarios where the actual amounts of tokens provided to the liquidity pool are less than anticipated, resulting in financial loss and reduced efficiency of the liquidity provision.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement slippage protection in the `_mintPosition` function by setting appropriate `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` values.
