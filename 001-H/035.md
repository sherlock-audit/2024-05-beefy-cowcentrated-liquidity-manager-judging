# No slippage protection when minting a position

## Summary
No slippage protection was set when minting a position. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Setting amount0Min and amount1Min to zero. A function calling mint with no slippage protection would be vulnerable to a frontrunning attack designed to execute the mint call at an inaccurate price.

## Impact
As there's no safety-net preventing the slippage from a frontrunner. The intent of minting a desired amount and what actually has been minted could in fact lead to serious unintentional interference from the contract leading to substantial loses in the process.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add another field to the contract where the owner can set the expected percentage minted
e.g.
```solidity
amount0Min: _amount0 * 0.95
amount1Min: _amount1 * 0.95
...
```
