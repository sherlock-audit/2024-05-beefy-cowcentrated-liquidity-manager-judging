# No slippage protection when decreasing liquidity from a position

## Summary
No slippage protection was set when removing liquidity from a position. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Setting amount0Min and amount1Min to zero. No slippage protection would be vulnerable to a front-running attack.

## Impact
As there's no safety-net preventing the slippage from a frontrunner changing the price at last minute, when we expected the proportion from amount0 and amount1 to be one but due to the last changes to differ what has been expected.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
amount0Min: 0, 
amount1Min: 0,
...
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add another field to the contract where the owner can set the expected percentage minted
e.g.
```solidity
amount0Min: _amount0 * 0.95
amount1Min: _amount1 * 0.95
...
```
