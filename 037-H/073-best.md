# Liquidity providers cannot receive the trading fee rewards they are entitled to

## Summary
Liquidity providers cannot receive the trading fee rewards they are entitled to
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
    function _harvest (address _callFeeRecipient) private {
        // Claim rewards from gauge
        _claimEarnings();

        // Charge fees for Beefy and send them to the appropriate addresses, charge fees to accrued state fee amounts.
        (uint256 feeLeft) = _chargeFees(_callFeeRecipient, fees);

        // Reset state fees to 0. 
        fees = 0;

        // Notify rewards with our velo. 
@>      IRewardPool(rewardPool).notifyRewardAmount(output, feeLeft, 1 days);

        // Log the last time we claimed fees. 
        lastHarvest = block.timestamp;

        // Log the fees post Beefy fees.
        emit Harvest(feeLeft);
    }
```
We can see that left fee rewards arg given to rewardPool. 
There are two scenarios belowï¼š
1. The liquidity provider has not staked in the rewardPool and will not receive any rewards.
2. Even if staked, since the rewardPool releases rewards linearly over a day, a portion of the rewards will always be inaccessible.
#### poc for 2
- a. alice provides lptoken0 and lptoken1 ,meanwhile gets vault share token
- b. then stakes share token to rewardPool
- c. After a day has passed.
- d. alice call harvest() 
- e. After a day has passed.
- f. alice get all rewards of the first day. Then she wants to get her liquidity back.
Even if she calls harvest(), she cannot receive her rewards for the second day.
## Impact
Liquidity providers lose their fee rewards.
