# Arbitrary Manipulation of sqrtPriceX96 Compromising Integrity of Liquidity Addition Mechanism

## Summary
The sqrtPriceX96 value, which is the latest price data from the Velodrome pool, can be easily manipulated by anyone. This can be achieved by swapping tokens before the sqrtPriceX96 is read by the Strategy and swapping back immediately after.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome::sqrtPrice()`  in the contract can be easily manipulated by anyone. This manipulation is possible because the function reads the current price from the pool, which can be temporarily altered through token swaps.



## Impact

This vulnerability impacts the _addLiquidity() function used to deposit liquidity and mint an LP token as an NFT. By manipulating the sqrtPriceX96, an attacker can influence the amount of liquidity added and potentially gain an unfair advantage.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) from the protocol itself with a custom duration to limit the possibility of price manipulation.
