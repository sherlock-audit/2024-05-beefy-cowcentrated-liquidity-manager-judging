# Usage of `slot0` is extremely easy to manipulate

## Summary
The `sqrtPrice()` function in `StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol` relies on `slot0()` from the pool, which is susceptible to manipulation. The derived `sqrtPrice` is used in the `_addLiquidity` function, impacting critical operations such as `deposit` and `withdraw`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Beefy is using `slot0` to calculate several variables in their codebase:

 [slot0](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/core/interfaces/pool/IUniswapV3PoolState#slot0) is the most recent data point and is therefore extremely easy to manipulate.

 ```js
     function sqrtPrice() public view returns (uint160 sqrtPriceX96) {
        (sqrtPriceX96,,,,,) = IVeloPool(pool).slot0();
    }
 ```
 the `sqrtPrice` is derived from `slot0()`, which can be easily manipulated

 the calculated `sqrtPrice` is used in [_addLiquidity](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-beefy-cowcentrated-liquidity-manager/blob/42ef5f0eac1bc954e888cf5bfb85cbf24c08ec76/cowcentrated-contracts/contracts/strategies/velodrome/StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol#L254)

Furthermore, `_addLiquidity` is called in many functions including the crucial `deposit` and `withdraw`

`_addLiquidity` also calls [_mintPosition](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-beefy-cowcentrated-liquidity-manager/blob/42ef5f0eac1bc954e888cf5bfb85cbf24c08ec76/cowcentrated-contracts/contracts/strategies/velodrome/StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol#L297) to mint a new position for the main or alternative position.
## Impact
Since slot0() can be easily manipulated, the `sqrtPrice` used for liquidity calculations can be skewed. This manipulation can lead to inaccurate liquidity provision, resulting in potential financial losses or unfair advantage to malicious actors during deposit and withdraw operations.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enhance the robustness of the price data by using a time-weighted average price (TWAP) instead of relying solely on the latest data point from `slot0()`.
