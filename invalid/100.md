# Phishing_Attack

## Summary
The `StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome::harvest` function in the contract is currently using `tx.origin` instead of `msg.sender`. This introduces a security vulnerability where an attacker could exploit the function by phishing or using malicious contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome::harvest` utilizes `tx.origin`, which refers to the original external account that initiated the transaction. This can be exploited by attackers through phishing attacks or malicious contracts to trick users into unknowingly executing the `harvest` function.

## Impact
An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `harvest` function on behalf of an unsuspecting user. By using `tx.origin`, the contract incorrectly attributes the action to the original external account, allowing the attacker to manipulate the function and potentially harvest as if they were the legitimate caller.

More info on such attacks can be found [here](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/phishing-with-tx-origin/?ref=hackernoon.com)

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function harvest() external {
    _harvest(tx.origin);
}
```

## Proof Of Concept
If we make such an attack contract:
```solidity
contract Attack {
    StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome strategy;

    constructor(address _strategy) {
        strategy = StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome(_strategy);
    }

    function attack() public {
        strategy.harvest();
    }
}
```
Basically we can use phishing techniques to make anyone call the `attack` function which calls the `harvest` function. Due to the fact that the `harvest` function uses `tx.origin` then basically anyone calling the `attack` function will be harvesting as if they called the function.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace `tx.origin` with `msg.sender` to ensure that the caller of the `harvest` function is correctly identified.

Updated code:
```solidity
function harvest() external {
    _harvest(msg.sender);
}
```
