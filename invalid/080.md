# Paused state is not checked in deposit function

## Summary
Paused state is not checked.
## Vulnerability Detail
The strategy can be paused under certain periods that are considered to be dangerous for the system. This is usually done to protect the system from attacks or to prevent the system from making
bad decisions.

However, the deposit function doesn't perform checks on whether the system is paused or not. This means
that users can still interact with the system, even though it is paused. This can lead to unexpected
behavior and potential losses for the users.
## Impact
This issue can lead to unexpected behavior and potential losses for the users.

```Solidity
function deposit() external onlyCalmPeriods {
        _onlyVault();

        if (!initTicks) {
            _setTicks();
            initTicks = true;
        }

        // Add all liquidity
        _addLiquidity();
        
        (uint256 bal0, uint256 bal1) = balances();

        // TVL Balances after deposit
        emit TVL(bal0, bal1);
    }
```
