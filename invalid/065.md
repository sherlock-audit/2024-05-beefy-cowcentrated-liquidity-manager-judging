# Changing `positionWidth` while protocol is paused will lose most of the contract's funds

## Summary
Changing `positionWidth` while protocol is paused will lose most of the contract's funds

## Vulnerability Detail
When the protocol's paused, all liquidity is removed from the pool up until it is `unpaused`. However, if during the pause `positionWidth` is changed, this will still add liquidity to the pool.

```solidity
    function setPositionWidth(int24 _width) external onlyOwner {
        emit SetPositionWidth(positionWidth, _width);
        _claimEarnings();
        _removeLiquidity();
        positionWidth = _width;
        _setTicks();
        _addLiquidity();
    }
```

 While this is a problem not only because funds are deposited during `emergency` mode, but also because then after some time, when `unpause` is called, `_addLiquidity` will be called again and will overwrite the `nftId` values, making old NFT ids inaccessible and forever lost. 

```solidity
    function _mintPosition(int24 _tickLower, int24 _tickUpper, uint256 _amount0, uint256 _amount1, bool _mainPosition) private {
        INftPositionManager.MintParams memory mintParams = INftPositionManager.MintParams({
            token0: lpToken0,
            token1: lpToken1,
            tickSpacing: _tickDistance(),
            tickLower: _tickLower,
            tickUpper: _tickUpper,
            amount0Desired: _amount0,
            amount1Desired: _amount1,
            amount0Min: 0,
            amount1Min: 0,
            recipient: address(this),
            deadline: block.timestamp,
            sqrtPriceX96: 0
        });

        (uint256 nftId,,,) = INftPositionManager(nftManager).mint(mintParams);

        if (_mainPosition) positionMain.nftId = nftId;
        else positionAlt.nftId = nftId;

        IERC721(nftManager).approve(gauge, nftId);
    }
```

Since the two functions are callable by different wallets/ timelocks, a bad timing of transactions might cause this to happen. Furthermore, if timelock is used for the calling of these functions, a mismatch of transaction order might also cause this.

Same issue with `moveTicks` which is callable by Rebalancer

## Recommendation
If `positionWidth` is changed while contract is paused, do not add liquidity
