# If keeper pauses the strategy and `owner` is renounced, it will result in permanent lock of the strategy

## Summary
If keeper pauses the strategy and `owner` is renounced, it will result in permanent lock of the strategy

## Vulnerability Detail
The strategy can be paused via the `panic` function, which has a `onlyManager` modifier. The modifier allows only owner or keeper to call the function.

```solidity
    function panic(uint256 _minAmount0, uint256 _minAmount1) public onlyManager {
        _claimEarnings();
        _removeLiquidity();
        _removeAllowances();
        _pause();

        (uint256 bal0, uint256 bal1) = balances();
        if (bal0 < _minAmount0 || bal1 < _minAmount1) revert TooMuchSlippage();
    }
```
```solidity
    modifier onlyManager() {
        if (msg.sender != owner() && msg.sender != keeper()) revert NotManager();
        _;
    }
```
However, the problem is that the function responsible for unpausing requires owner to not be renounced. Hence, if `keeper` has to temporarily pause the strategy due to an emergency, they will not be able to later `unpause` it and would result in a permanent lock

```solidity
    function unpause() external onlyManager {
        if (owner() == address(0)) revert NotAuthorized();
        _giveAllowances();
        _unpause();
        _setTicks();
        _addLiquidity();
    }
```
