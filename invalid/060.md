# Ineffective slippage check due to Incorrect order of operation in the panic() function .

## Summary
The  function `panic()`   in the `StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome` contract   handles situations by claiming earnings, removing liquidity, removing allowances, and pausing the contract. However, the order of operations within the function can cause the slippage check to be ineffective, allowing critical actions to be executed even if slippage conditions are not met.

## Vulnerability Detail


The issue arises from the placement of the slippage check after the `_claimEarnings()`, `_removeLiquidity()`, `_removeAllowances()`, and `_pause()` calls. This sequence means that the function performs these actions before verifying if the balance conditions `_minAmount0` and `_minAmount1` are satisfied.

Below is the  panic()  function :
```solidity
    function panic(uint256 _minAmount0, uint256 _minAmount1) public onlyManager {
        _claimEarnings();
        _removeLiquidity();
        _removeAllowances();
        _pause();

//@audit :
        (uint256 bal0, uint256 bal1) = balances();
        if (bal0 < _minAmount0 || bal1 < _minAmount1) revert TooMuchSlippage();
    }

```

As you can see  the slippage check occurs after critical operations.

## Impact
If the balances of `bal0` and `bal1` are below the specified minimum amounts `_minAmount0` and `_minAmount1`, since the slippage check occurs after critical operations, these actions may still execute, leading to undesirable consequences such as incomplete or incorrect state changes,

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

```diff

function panic(uint256 _minAmount0, uint256 _minAmount1) public onlyManager {
    // Get current balances before taking any action
 + (uint256 bal0, uint256 bal1) = balances();
 + if (bal0 < _minAmount0 || bal1 < _minAmount1) revert TooMuchSlippage();

    _claimEarnings();
    _removeLiquidity();
    _removeAllowances();
    _pause();


//move the check above
 - (uint256 bal0, uint256 bal1) = balances();
 - if (bal0 < _minAmount0 || bal1 < _minAmount1) revert TooMuchSlippage();
     
}

```
