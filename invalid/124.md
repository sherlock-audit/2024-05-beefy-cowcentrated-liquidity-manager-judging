# `StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.retireVault` can be DOSed

## Summary
`StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.retireVault` can be used to terminate the contract, after calling the function, the contract will be paused, the ownership will be tranferred to `address(0)`. When the ownership is tranferred to `address(0)`, the paused contract can't be unpaused again because of [StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol#L819](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-beefy-cowcentrated-liquidity-manager/blob/main/cowcentrated-contracts/contracts/strategies/velodrome/StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol#L819)

## Vulnerability Detail
In `StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.retireVault` there is a check that `IBeefyVaultConcLiq(vault).totalSupply()` must be __10**3__, otherwise the function will revert in [StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol#L794](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-beefy-cowcentrated-liquidity-manager/blob/42ef5f0eac1bc954e888cf5bfb85cbf24c08ec76/cowcentrated-contracts/contracts/strategies/velodrome/StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol#L794),  so to DoS the function, a malicious only needs to deposit __one__ share in the `vault`

## Impact
StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.retireVault can be used to terminate the contract, after calling the function, the contract will be paused, the ownership will be tranferred to address(0). When the ownership is tranferred to address(0), the paused contract can't be unpaused again because of [StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol#L819](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-beefy-cowcentrated-liquidity-manager/blob/main/cowcentrated-contracts/contracts/strategies/velodrome/StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol#L819)
