# Uncontrolled actions after transferral of contract ownership

## Summary

In StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol, in the `retireVault` function, `unirouter` and `owner` are set to `address(0)`. 

## Vulnerability Detail

After this, the contract ownership is transferred to the zero address. If the owner is transferred to an address that is not in your control or does not have smart contract capabilities, all functions with `onlyOwner` modifier will be locked forever , as the contract owner address `0x0` is reserved and cannot be used to send transactions. 

## Impact

All functions with `onlyOwner` modifier will be locked forever, for example retireVault(), setOutputToNativePath(),  setDeviation(), setTwapInterval(), setPositionWidth(), setRewardPool()

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function retireVault() external onlyOwner {
    if (IBeefyVaultConcLiq(vault).totalSupply() != 10**3) revert NotAuthorized();
    panic(0,0);
    address feeRecipient = beefyFeeRecipient();
    IERC20Metadata(lpToken0).safeTransfer(feeRecipient, IERC20Metadata(lpToken0).balanceOf(address(this)));
    IERC20Metadata(lpToken1).safeTransfer(feeRecipient, IERC20Metadata(lpToken1).balanceOf(address(this)));
    _transferOwnership(address(0));
}
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You might want to consider a solution where the contract ownership is transferred to a protocol-owned emergency address from which specific mitigation actions can be taken.
