# Potential Overflow in FullMath.mulDiv

## Vulnerability Detail
The function uses `FullMath.mulDiv` to perform multiplication followed by division:
```solidity
uint256 intermediate = FullMath.mulDiv(sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, FixedPoint96.Q96);
```

## Impact
If `FullMath.mulDiv` does not handle overflows correctly, it could lead to incorrect calculations of intermediate values. This could result in incorrect liquidity calculations, potentially leading to financial losses for users or the contract itself.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- One effective way to mitigate overflow risks is to use a widely used math library that is known to handle overflows correctly. OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library is a common choice for this purpose.
- If you prefer to use your custom math function or ensure more control over the implementation, you can add explicit overflow checks in your custom `mulDiv` function. This method involves adding checks to ensure intermediate values do not overflow during calculations.
