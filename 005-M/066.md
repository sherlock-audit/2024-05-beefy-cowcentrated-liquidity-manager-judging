# Dangerous use of deadline parameter

## Summary

The protocol is using `block.timestamp` as the deadline argument while interacting with the Velodrome NFT Position Manager, which completely defeats the purpose of using a deadline.

## Vulnerability Detail

Most of the functions that interact with AMM pools do not have a deadline parameter, but specifically the shown below is passing `block.timestamp` to a pool, which means that whenever the miner decides to include the txn in a block, it will be valid at that time, since `block.timestamp` will be the current timestamp.

```solidity
  function _mintPosition(int24 _tickLower, int24 _tickUpper, uint256 _amount0, uint256 _amount1, bool _mainPosition) private {
   INftPositionManager.MintParams memory mintParams = INftPositionManager.MintParams({
            token0: lpToken0,
            token1: lpToken1,
            tickSpacing: _tickDistance(),
            tickLower: _tickLower,
            tickUpper: _tickUpper,
            amount0Desired: _amount0,
            amount1Desired: _amount1,
            amount0Min: 0,
            amount1Min: 0,
            recipient: address(this),
            deadline: block.timestamp,
            sqrtPriceX96: 0
        });

   ...//
  }
  
   function _removeLiquidity() private {
     
        if (liquidity > 0) {
            decreaseLiquidityParams = INftPositionManager.DecreaseLiquidityParams({
                tokenId: positionMain.nftId,
                liquidity: liquidity,
                amount0Min: 0,
                amount1Min: 0,
                deadline: block.timestamp
            });

          }
        ...//

          if (liquidityAlt > 0) {
            decreaseLiquidityParams = INftPositionManager.DecreaseLiquidityParams({
                tokenId: positionAlt.nftId,
                liquidity: liquidityAlt,
                amount0Min: 0,
                amount1Min: 0,
                deadline: block.timestamp
            });
          
           }

         ...//

   }
```
 Front-running is a key aspect of AMM design, deadline is a useful tool to ensure that your tx cannot be “saved for later”. Due to the removal of the check, it may be more profitable for a miner to deny the transaction from being mined until the transaction incurs the maximum amount of slippage.

## Impact

Failure to provide a proper deadline value enables pending transactions to be maliciously executed at a later point. Transactions that provide an insufficient amount of gas such that they are not mined within a reasonable amount of time, can be picked by malicious actors or MEV bots and executed later in detriment of the submitter.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a deadline parameter to the functions that are used to manage the liquidity position. Forward this parameter to the corresponding underlying calls to the  StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome  contract.
