# Using `block.timestamp` for swap deadline offers no protection

## Summary
`block.timestamp` is used as the deadline for swaps in in VeloSwapUtils#swap

which is used in `StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol#harvest`. The deadline parameter is given as block.timestamp which offers no protection 

## Vulnerability Detail
The function call chain is follows


 `StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol#harvest->_harvest->chargeFees->swap()`

```solidity
   function swap(
        address _router,
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _amountIn,
        bool _isV3
    ) internal {
        if (_isV3) {
            bytes memory input = abi.encode(address(this), _amountIn, 0, _path, true);
            bytes[] memory inputs = new bytes[](1);
            inputs[0] = input;
            IVeloRouter(_router).execute(abi.encodePacked(V3_SWAP_EXACT_IN), inputs, block.timestamp);
        } else {
            address[] memory route = pathToRoute(_path);
            bytes memory input = abi.encode(address(this), _amountIn, 0, route, true);
            bytes[] memory inputs = new bytes[](1);
            inputs[0] = input;

            IVeloRouter(_router).execute(abi.encodePacked(V2_SWAP_EXACT_IN), inputs, block.timestamp);
        }
```
There are multiple instances of swap methods in this contract.

They all use block.timestamp as deadline .

In the PoS model, proposers know well in advance if they will propose one or consecutive blocks ahead of time. In such a scenario, a malicious validator can hold back the transaction and execute it at a more favourable block number.

As block,timestamp will always be a valid deadline when transaction executes because the transactions on EVM chains 

are atomic .

If let's say the transaction is initiated at block,timestamp 1000 , but processed at timestamp 1015 ,

the block.timestamp value throughout will be 1015.

When the deadline is checked , this will essentially be a self comparison of 1015 ( e.g 1015 <= 1015 )

and the swap will be successful no matter if the transaction was indeed intended to be done on that timestamp or not.

## Impact
While there is no direct loss of funds i think but there might be discrepency in the native amounts earned through chargeFees method which can lead to loss of funds to `feeRecipient, strategist and beefyFeeRecipient` if the output amount is very less

because transferred native tokens will be very less than intended , disturbing protocol's inner accounting

```solidity
  uint256 callFeeAmount = nativeEarned * fee.call / DIVISOR;
        IERC20Metadata(native).safeTransfer(_callFeeRecipient, callFeeAmount);

        uint256 strategistFeeAmount = nativeEarned * fee.strategist / DIVISOR;
        IERC20Metadata(native).safeTransfer(strategist, strategistFeeAmount);

        uint256 beefyFeeAmount = nativeEarned - callFeeAmount - strategistFeeAmount;
        IERC20Metadata(native).safeTransfer(beefyFeeRecipient(), beefyFeeAmount);

```

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Ensure some minimum amount is received out of the swap and its in acceptable range for the protocol.
