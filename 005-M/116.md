# Using `block.timestamp` for swap deadline offers no protection

## Summary
The StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol::_mintPosition function uses block.timestamp for the swap deadline, which provides no protection against transaction manipulation by malicious validators. 
## Vulnerability Detail
 `block.timestamp` is used as the deadline for minting position in 
`StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol::_mintPosition` [317]( https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-beefy-cowcentrated-liquidity-manager/blob/42ef5f0eac1bc954e888cf5bfb85cbf24c08ec76/cowcentrated-contracts/contracts/strategies/velodrome/StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol#L317) 

In the PoS model, proposers know well in advance if they will propose one or consecutive blocks ahead of time. In such a scenario, a malicious validator can hold back the transaction and execute it at a more favourable block number.
## Impact
This offers no protection as `block.timestamp` will have the value of whichever block the txn is inserted into, hence the txn can be held indefinitely by malicious validators.

## Recommendation
Consider allowing function caller to specify `deadline` input parameter.
