# No correction on a deadline when minting/burning etc

## Summary
No correction on the deadline

## Vulnerability Detail
Not setting a higher deadline could lead to unintentional behaviour. The tx would revert every time the deadline doesn't alight with the current block timestamp. If the network is congested minting and burning would always fail due to going pass the deadline.

## Impact
Disallowing a strategy that controls minting and burning due to improper configuration could result in significant losses if the strategy does not perform as backtested.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a field where owner can set the additional time or just hardcode 300 depending on the network this number might not be sufficient
e.g.

```solidity
deadline: block.timestamp + 300
```
