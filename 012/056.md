# Inconsistency Between Comments and Implementation in balances() Function

## Summary
Inconsistency between code implementation and comments in the `balances()` function 

## Vulnerability Detail
The comment on line 527 indicates that the function should return the sum of the contract's balance and the pool's balance minus any unharvested fees (`feesUnharvested`). However, the actual implementation does not perform this subtraction, leading to potentially incorrect reporting of token balances.

```solidity
 function balances() public view returns (uint256 token0Bal, uint256 token1Bal) {
        (uint256 thisBal0, uint256 thisBal1) = balancesOfThis();
        (uint256 poolBal0, uint256 poolBal1,,,,) = balancesOfPool();

        uint256 total0 = thisBal0 + poolBal0;
        uint256 total1 = thisBal1 + poolBal1;

        // For token0 and token1 we return balance of this contract + balance of positions - feesUnharvested.
        return (total0, total1);
    }
```
## Impact
This leads to inaccurate reflection of the actual total token balances held by the strategy, potentially affecting decision-making processes related to liquidity management, fee distribution, and overall strategy

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To align the implementation with the comment and ensure accurate reporting of token balances, consider modifying the `balances()` function to subtract `feesUnharvested` from the total balances. Additionally, ensure that `feesUnharvested` is properly defined and updated within the contract to accurately reflect uncollected fees.
