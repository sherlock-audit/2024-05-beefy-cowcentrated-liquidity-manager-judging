# Potential for Price Manipulation in Using `slot0` to Obtain `sqrtPriceX96`

## Summary
This report details a vulnerability in decentralized exchange protocols that rely on liquidity pools, specifically focusing on the manipulation of the `sqrtPriceX96` value obtained from the `slot0` function. This vulnerability can be exploited through Miner Extractable Value (MEV) strategies, flash loans, and sandwich attacks, potentially leading to significant financial losses for users interacting with affected functions.
## Vulnerability Detail
The core of the vulnerability lies in the reliance on the `slot0` function, which provides the most recent data point for several key state variables, including `sqrtPriceX96`. This data point can be manipulated by attackers using various techniques:

- MEV Strategies: Miners or validators can reorder, insert, or censor transactions to manipulate the `slot0` data to their advantage.
- Flash Loans: Attackers can borrow large amounts of tokens temporarily, manipulate the pool’s state, and repay the loan within the same transaction.
- Sandwich Attacks: Attackers place large buy/sell orders around a target transaction to exploit price slippage and manipulate the `slot0` data.
## Impact
- `currentTick()` Function: While this function retrieves the current tick, it can be indirectly affected by manipulations in `slot0`.
- `price()` Function: This function’s accuracy depends on `sqrtPriceX96`. Manipulated `sqrtPriceX96` leads to incorrect price calculations, potentially causing significant financial losses.
- `sqrtPrice()` Function: Directly retrieves the manipulated `sqrtPriceX96`, leading to inaccuracies.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Integrate TWAP in Critical Functions: Modify functions that depend on price data, such as `price()`, to use TWAP instead of the latest price
