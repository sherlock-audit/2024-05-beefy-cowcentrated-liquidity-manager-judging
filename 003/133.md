# Usage of slot0 is extremely easy to manipulate

## Summary
Beefy is using slot0 to calculate sqrtprice and several variables in their codebase 
## Vulnerability Detail

in sqrtPrice() sqrtpriceX96 is getting from IVeloPool(pool).slot0(). 
slot0 is the most recent data point and is therefore extremely easy to manipulate.

sqrtPrice is called in _addLiquidity() , balancesOfPool() and other functions too.
So attacker can manipulate the number of tokens ( balance) which could cause problem
This allows a malicious user to manipulate the valuation of the LP. And it could also lead to slippage.

## Impact

balances of tokens is calculated from this and it can be manipulated.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
  Use TWAP to calculate price instead of slot0
