# Missing `onlyCalmPeriods` modifier on important functions

## Summary
Missing `onlyCalmPeriods` modifier on important functions

## Vulnerability Detail
Beefy tries to to protect its users from price manipulation attacks (e.g. flash loan attacks) and it does so by allowing them to deposit only during a calm period. This is done with the implementation of the `onlyCalmPeriods` modifier. However the issue is that this modifier is not used on the `withdraw()` and `harvest()` functions.

## Impact
Because of this users are allowed to withdraw and harvest during unsafe periods which may lead to a loss for them

## Recommendation
Add the onlyCalmPeriods modifier to the `withdraw()` and `harvest()` functions
