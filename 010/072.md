# Frontrun `harvest()` to get more rewards


## Summary
Frontrun `harvest()` to get more rewards
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
    function _harvest (address _callFeeRecipient) private {
        // Claim rewards from gauge
        _claimEarnings();

        // Charge fees for Beefy and send them to the appropriate addresses, charge fees to accrued state fee amounts.
        (uint256 feeLeft) = _chargeFees(_callFeeRecipient, fees);

        // Reset state fees to 0. 
        fees = 0;

        // Notify rewards with our velo. 
@>      IRewardPool(rewardPool).notifyRewardAmount(output, feeLeft, 1 days);

        // Log the last time we claimed fees. 
        lastHarvest = block.timestamp;

        // Log the fees post Beefy fees.
        emit Harvest(feeLeft);
    }
```
We can see that left fee rewards arg given to rewardPool in `_harvest()`, An attacker can spot a transaction with a large reward in the memory pool, front-run it with staking on rewardPool, and gain more rewards.
