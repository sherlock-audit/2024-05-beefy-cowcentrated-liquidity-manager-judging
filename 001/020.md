# `StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome` does not reset the reward pool's allowance upon setting the new reward pool

## Summary

`StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome` does not reset the reward pool's allowance upon setting the new reward pool, which still giving the old reward pool allowance and the new reward pool can not spend the `output` token.

## Vulnerability Detail

The strategy does not reset the `rewardPool`'s allowance in the `setRewardPool()` function.

## Impact

The old reward pool still have allowance on the `output` token.

The strategy can not harvest reward after setting the new reward pool, because the new reward pool would fail to `notifyRewardAmount`, because it has not been approved to spend the `output` token.
