# The maximum tick deviation should be less than or equal to 4 times the tick spacing in the setDeviation function


## Summary
According to the code comments, The setDeviation function should ensure that `maxTickDeviation` is less than or equal to 4 times the tick spacing.
This requirement is currently not properly enforced, potentially allowing `maxTickDeviation` to be set incorrectly.
>If the protocol team provides specific information in the README or CODE COMMENTS, that information stands above all judging rules. In case of contradictions between the README and CODE COMMENTS, the README is the chosen source of truth.

## Vulnerability Detail
contracts/strategies/velodrome/StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol#L709
```solidity
    function setDeviation(int56 _maxDeviation) external onlyOwner {
        emit SetDeviation(_maxDeviation);

        // Require the deviation to be less than or equal to 4 times the tick spacing.
        if (_maxDeviation >= _tickDistance() * 4) revert InvalidInput(); // @audit >

        maxTickDeviation = _maxDeviation;
    }
```

## Impact
The maxTickDeviation cannot be set to exactly 4 times the tick spacing due to the current condition

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's recommended to change the condition to properly allow maxTickDeviation to be set to 4 times the tick spacing or less.

```diff
    function setDeviation(int56 _maxDeviation) external onlyOwner {
        emit SetDeviation(_maxDeviation);

        // Require the deviation to be less than or equal to 4 times the tick spacing.
-        if (_maxDeviation >= _tickDistance() * 4) revert InvalidInput();
+        if (_maxDeviation > _tickDistance() * 4) revert InvalidInput();

        maxTickDeviation = _maxDeviation;
    }
```
