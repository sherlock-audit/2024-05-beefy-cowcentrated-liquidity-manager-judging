# `twap()` would return the wrong prices for negative tick deltas since it doesn't round up for them

## Summary
In case if `(tickCuml[1] - tickCumul[0])` is negative and `(tickCuml[1] - tickCuml[0]) % secondsAgo != 0`, then returned tick will be bigger than it should be

## Vulnerability Detail
First take a look [here:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-beefy-cowcentrated-liquidity-manager/blob/main/cowcentrated-contracts/contracts/strategies/velodrome/StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome.sol#L741-L748)

```solidity
function twap() public view returns (int56 twapTick) {
        uint32[] memory secondsAgo = new uint32[](2);
        secondsAgo[0] = uint32(twapInterval);
        secondsAgo[1] = 0;

        (int56[] memory tickCuml,) = IVeloPool(pool).observe(secondsAgo);
        twapTick = (tickCuml[1] - tickCuml[0]) / int32(twapInterval);
    }
```

This function is used to compute the twap of a Veledrome pool using data from its oracle, and then it returns the final calculated twap tick as the median price, but multiple data in the array could be flawed because current implementation deviates from the standard.


Looking at the implementation, we can see that the differences between the `tickCuml` is considered the `tickCummulativeDelta`, and in a case where this delta is less than `0`, a check is implemented to see if the delta is directly divisible by the twap duration, if not the tick calculated is rounded down, i.e:   `if (tickCumulativesDelta < 0 && (tickCumulativesDelta % secondsAgo != 0)) arithmeticMeanTick--;`

The problem is that in case if `(tickCuml[1] - tickCuml[0])` is negative, then the tick should be rounded down.

As a result, in case if `(tickCuml[1] - tickCuml[0])` is negative and `(tickCuml[1] - tickCuml[0) % secondsAgo != 0`, then returned tick will be bigger then it should be which places `Beefy` wanting prices to be right not be able to achieve this goal and also, this opens possibility for some price manipulations and arbitrage opportunities.


## Impact
In case if `(tickCuml[1] - tickCumul[0])` is negative and `(tickCuml[1] - tickCuml[0]) % secondsAgo != 0`, then returned tick will be bigger than it should be which places `Beefy` wanting prices to be right not be able to achieve this goal and also causing the pricing logic to be unavailable to important functions that query this `twap` function. This opens possibility for some price manipulations and arbitrage opportunities.

## Recommendation
Add this line to `twap()`:

`if (tickCuml[1] - tickCuml[0] < 0 && (tickCuml[1] - tickCuml[0]) % secondsAgo != 0) timeWeightedTick --;`
