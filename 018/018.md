# Add default constructor that calls `_disableInitializers()` to StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome

## Summary

`StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome` contract uses upgradable contracts. 
Calling the `initialize()` function directly on the implementation contract behind a proxy is dangerous. 
In such case, if the implementation calls self-destruct or performs delegate calls itâ€™s possible to delete the implementation leaving the contract bricked. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Upgradable contracts are an essential protocol feature, allowing for flexible updates and maintenance. 
Contracts should include a default constructor calling `_disableInitializers()` function: (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol#L192) of `Initializable.sol`.

## Impact

When implementing upgradable contracts, ensuring that the `initialize()` function is not accidentally called directly on the implementation contract behind the proxy is crucial. 

If this occurs and the implementation contract contains self-destruct or delegate calls, it can result in the unintended deletion of the implementation contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Please append StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome#`constructor()` same as StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap#`constructor()`.

```diff
contract StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome is 
	StratFeeManagerInitializable, IStrategyConcLiq, IStrategyVelodrome {
	...
	event ClaimedFees(uint256 fees);

++	constructor() {
++		_disableInitializers();
++	}
	
	modifier onlyCalmPeriods() {
		_onlyCalmPeriods();
		_;
	}
	...
}
```
Include a default constructor in the contract that calls the `_disableInitializers()` function from `Initializable.sol`. This ensures that initializers cannot be accidentally invoked on the implementation contract.
