# StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome::withdraw missing the _onlyCalmPeriods check

## Summary
StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome::withdraw missing the _onlyCalmPeriods check
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
function withdraw(uint256 _amount0, uint256 _amount1) external {
        _onlyVault();

        // Liquidity has already been removed in beforeAction() so this is just a simple withdraw.
        if (_amount0 > 0) IERC20Metadata(lpToken0).safeTransfer(vault, _amount0);
        if (_amount1 > 0) IERC20Metadata(lpToken1).safeTransfer(vault, _amount1);

        // After we take what is needed we add it all back to our positions. 
        if (!_isPaused()) _addLiquidity();

        (uint256 bal0, uint256 bal1) = balances();

        // TVL Balances after withdraw
        emit TVL(bal0, bal1);
    }
```
When a withdraw is initiated, BeefyVaultConcLiq::withdraw calls StrategyPassiveMan-
StrategyPassiveManagerVelodrome::beforeAction which removes the liquidity.
In 4 other places when liquidity has been removed and added, onlyCalmPeriods is always checked immediately before calling _- addLiquidity in `deposit()`, `moveTicks()`, `setPositionWidth()`, `unpause()`.

## Impact
Whenever withdrawals occur the newly added liquidity can be based off a stale current tick. The most likely result of this is reduced liquidity provider rewards due to a non-optimal LP position.
