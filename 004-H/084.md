# Withdraw function is missing onlyCalmPeriods modifier

## Summary
Withdraw function is missing onlyCalmPeriods modifier
## Vulnerability Detail
The onlyCalmPeriods modifier is a critical safety component of the strategy, as it is used to prevent deposits and harvests when the current price is not within a certain deviation of twap. This is to protect against price manipulation by an attacker during their transaction, possibly using flash loans or other means.

Both the harvest function as well as withdraw do not check whether the system is in a calm period or not. This means that users can still interact with the system, even though it is not safe to do so. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential losses for the users.

## Impact
This issue can lead to unexpected slippage for the users as well as potential losses for the protocol.

```Solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _amount0, uint256 _amount1) external {
        _onlyVault();

        // Liquidity has already been removed in beforeAction() so this is just a simple withdraw.
        if (_amount0 > 0) IERC20Metadata(lpToken0).safeTransfer(vault, _amount0);
        if (_amount1 > 0) IERC20Metadata(lpToken1).safeTransfer(vault, _amount1);

        // After we take what is needed we add it all back to our positions. 
        if (!_isPaused()) _addLiquidity();

        (uint256 bal0, uint256 bal1) = balances();

        // TVL Balances after withdraw
        emit TVL(bal0, bal1);
    }
```

```Solidity
function harvest() external {
        _harvest(tx.origin);

        if (!_isPaused()) _addLiquidity();

        (uint256 bal0, uint256 bal1) = balances();

        // TVL Balances after withdraw
        emit TVL(bal0, bal1);
